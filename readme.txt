Connect is a mental health platform founded by 5 high school students to provide accessible and affordable mental health resources for young people. With therapy sessions, peer support, and educational tools, we empower students to develop the skills and resilience they need to thrive. Our goal is to create a supportive community of peers who understand the unique challenges of adolescence and help students take control of their mental health and well-being.
